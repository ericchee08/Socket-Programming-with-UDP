# Socket-Programming-with-UDP
UDP allows two or more processes running on different hosts to communicate. However, UDP differs from TCP (Transport Control Protocol) in many fundamental ways. First, UDP is a connectionless service - there is no handshaking to establish a communication pipe because UDP does not have a pipe. When UDP communicates, it attaches the destination address to each batch of data that is being sent  In UDP, the destination address is the IP address of the host and port number.  The host IP address, the port number and the actual data to be transferred are collectively called a ‘packet’. UDP provides an unreliable message-oriented service model, in that it makes a best effort to deliver the packet to the destination in a single operation at the sending side. UDP is a best-effort service; it makes no guarantee that the packet will be delivered. This is in contrast to TCP, which has a reliable service model
